This project aims to filter news sites and gather all news that are suspected to be fake.
Front End: React js
We have used Flask to deploy our Machine learning model.
Our Machine learning model was trained using bidirectional LSTM in tensorflow. And the model was used to predict the degree of fakeness of the news that we crawled using news API.
